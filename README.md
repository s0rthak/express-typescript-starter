This starter has been modified from the base setup created by [typescript-express-starter](https://github.com/ljlm0402/typescript-express-starter) using sequelize template

## Getting Started

- [ ] Uncomment `// DB.sequelize.sync({ force: false });` in `src/app.ts`

**Note:**
1. Please feel to modify the structure of the code based on your preference.
2. You are NOT allowed to turn off `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json`
